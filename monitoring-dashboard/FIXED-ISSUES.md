# Monitoring Dashboard - Issues Fixed

This document outlines the issues that were identified and fixed in the monitoring-dashboard project.

## 1. Configuration Files

**Issue:** Duplicate configuration files (.js, .mjs, and .ts versions) were causing conflicts.
**Solution:** Removed duplicate files and kept only the .js versions:
- Kept: `next.config.js`
- Kept: `postcss.config.js`
- Kept: `tailwind.config.js`
- Deleted: `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`

## 2. Type Definitions

**Issue:** Multiple conflicting type definitions in `types/metrics.ts` for the same concepts.
**Solution:** Consolidated the definitions by:
- Keeping the newer, complete versions
- Ensuring all types follow TypeScript best practices
- Organizing types into logical groups (metrics, alerts, insights, dashboard stats)
- Adding proper documentation for each group

## 3. Mock Data

**Issue:** Mock data structure in `lib/api/mock-data.ts` didn't align with the latest type definitions.
**Solution:** Updated the mock data to:
- Match the new type interfaces
- Use numerical timestamps (Timestamp = number) instead of ISO strings
- Update property names and structure to match the newer types
- Replace `tags` with `metadata` where appropriate
- Update arrays of related items to match newer structures
- Renamed the function from `generateWebSocketMessage` to `simulateWSMessage` for consistency

## 4. API Response Type Safety

**Issue:** In `pages/index.tsx`, the error handling used `stats: null as any` which bypassed TypeScript checks.
**Solution:** 
- Provided proper default values that conform to the `DashboardStats` interface
- Removed unsafe type casting
- Ensured consistent handling of nullability throughout the app

## 5. Framework Approach Conflict

**Issue:** Mixed Next.js approaches with both `/app` directory (App Router) and `/pages` directory (Pages Router).
**Solution:**
- Removed the App Router (`/app`) implementation
- Standardized on the Pages Router (`/pages`) approach
- Removed corresponding `/app` files (layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css)

## 6. Component Structure

**Issue:** Legacy components from a previous implementation mixed with new components.
**Solution:**
- Created a clean component structure with only the new components:
  - `DashboardHeader.tsx`
  - `MetricsPanel.tsx`
  - `AlertsPanel.tsx`
  - `InsightsPanel.tsx`
- Moved old/unused components to a backup location

## 7. CSS Variables

**Issue:** CSS variables in globals.css were a mix of simple variables and Shadcn UI theme variables.
**Solution:**
- Kept both sets of variables for compatibility
- Ensured no conflicts between variables
- Made sure the body styling uses the correct variables

## 8. Dependencies

**Issue:** The project had dependencies that might not be necessary for the current implementation.
**Solution:**
- Kept the minimal necessary dependencies in package.json
- Removed dependencies on component libraries that aren't being used

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding E2E or unit tests to prevent regression issues
2. Document the type system more thoroughly
3. Consider adding proper error boundaries and loading states
4. Implement proper WebSocket connection (currently simulated)
